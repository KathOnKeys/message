        <h2>Happy First Monthsary, Lovey! 💖</h2>
    
        <p>Happy first monthsary sa atoa. One month pa lang ta, pero it already feels like we’ve shared more than just time—we’ve shared comfort, understanding, and moments that quietly matter. I didn’t expect nga mahimong ingani ko ka at ease with someone this early, but with you, everything feels natural. No pretending, no pressure, just being present and real with each other, and I’m really thankful for that.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for staying, especially sa mga adlaw nga dili ko maayo mu-express sa akong sarili. Salamat sa patience, sa effort, ug sa time nga you always choose to give. You listen even when I’m quiet, and you try to understand even when things are not clear. Those small actions mean so much to me, more than big words ever could.</p>
        
        <p>What I appreciate most about us is how we’re not rushing anything. Hinay-hinay lang ta, but steady. We’re learning each other’s moods, habits, and flaws, and we’re choosing to grow instead of forcing things. It feels calm, genuine, and safe, and that kind of connection is rare. Being with you gives me peace, and that’s something I truly value.</p>
        
        <p>One month is only the beginning, and I know daghan pa ta’g maagian—good days, bad days, misunderstandings, and lessons. But I’m grateful nga ikaw akong kauban ani nga journey. Thank you for choosing me, for being consistent, and for being you. Happy first monthsary to us, and amping always 🤍</p>
        
        <p>I love you so much! Happy first monthsary, loveyyy! ❤️</p>
